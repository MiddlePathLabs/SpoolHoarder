# Spool Hoarder

Spool Hoarder is a cross-platform app for tracking 3D printer filament inventory.

If you print regularly, you know the problem:
You buy spools you already own.  
You forget how much material is left.  
You can’t remember what filament you used for a past project.

Spool Hoarder keeps your inventory organized so you always know what you have.
